ElectronJS Desktop Application with C++ Backend

This project is a desktop application built using ElectronJS, React, TypeScript, and a C++ backend. The application demonstrates interaction between the frontend and backend by incrementing and displaying values using native C++ code through Node.js Addons (N-API).

Features :
-   Increment values with one click or custom input.
-   Integration with a C++ backend to handle computations.
-   Simple, modular design for easy extension.

Installation
-   Clone the repository.

Install dependencies:
-   npm install


Build the project:
-   npm run build

Run the application:
-   npm start

Challenges and Solutions :
The main challenge of this project was managing the dependencies to ensure compatibility between the various versions of Electron, Node.js, Electron-builder and the C++ backend. Proper research and understanding of versioning helped resolve these issues.

Additionally, my prior experience with Electron made the development process smoother. I approached the task with structured planning and organized the project files in a clear, logical manner for better maintainability.

Technologies Used :
-   ElectronJS
-   React
-   TypeScript
-   C++ Backend
-   Webpack for bundling
